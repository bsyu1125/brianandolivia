The tables are made out of backbone.js. Website is located here: [backgrid.js](http://backgridjs.com/)

A lot of the documentation was weak and unhelpful. There was a lot of background research to find out what it was doing.
There aren't a ton of stackoverflow questions about it too. Due to my lack of experience of JS and especially backbone, it was challenging.

I used Parse to hold all the data.
